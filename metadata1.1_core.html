<h1>CellML Metadata Specification 1.1 - Core Metadata</h1>
</div>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p class="text">This document specifies CellML Metadata 1.1 Core Metadata, the
recommended method for identifying types of metadata embedded in a CellML
document. <a href="../cellml_1.1">The CellML specification</a> recommends the
use of the Resource Description Framework for the association of metadata with
CellML objects. This document introduces the fundamentals of CellML Metadata
and demonstrates how the Dublin Core and vCard data models can be used to
classify metadata. </p>

<h2>Status of this document</h2>
This specification was frozen on 2005-06-28 and finalised on 2009-02-16. <br>

<h3><a id="sec_metadata_why" name="sec_metadata_why">1.1  Need for Metadata in
CellML</a></h3>

<p class="text">Metadata is usually defined as "data about data". It is the
supporting information that provides context to a resource. In CellML, the
model (i.e. the structure and mathematics of the model) is the resource.
Information that puts the model into a wider context is metadata. Metadata in
CellML includes information such as the literature reference that supports the
model, the identity of the creator(s) of the model, and the species for which
the model is relevant. </p>

<p class="text">The CellML project needs metadata for two primary reasons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>It will be difficult to reuse other people's models and components
    without metadata to provide the context for these objects. A modeller
    considering reusing someone else's model component will need to know things
    such as: what biological entity the component represents, for which species
    the component is relevant, and when the component was created and last
    modified (to help determine whether it is likely to incorporate the most
    recent experimental results). </li>
  <li>As the number of models and components grows, metadata will provide the
    only scalable method for locating particular models and components.
    Experience in other biological fields shows that as a field grows, powerful
    search techniques are needed to enable researchers to find relevant
    resources. These search techniques require structured metadata. </li>
</ul>

<p class="text">Metadata in CellML can be used in many different ways, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To support searches of a model repository (or at least to make it
    possible to automate loading of a database that will support such
    searches). </li>
  <li>To enable automatic discovery of models published on remote websites,
    such as laboratory websites. </li>
  <li>To allow the documentation for a model to be kept in the same document as
    the model itself, which will keep the documentation from becoming obsolete
    as work continues on the model. </li>
</ul>

<p class="text">The metadata structure should be flexible and extensible
because it is almost certain that we have not thought of all possible uses of
CellML Metadata. </p>

<h3><a id="sec_metadata_larger_picture"
name="sec_metadata_larger_picture">1.2  The Larger Metadata Picture</a></h3>

<p class="text">Currently it is not particularly easy to find a specific piece
of information on the web, and, once you have found the information, it is not
easy to determine whether or not you should trust it. Metadata can address both
of these problems. Therefore, there is a push to begin to incorporate metadata
into web resources to allow users to get the maximum use out of the information
on the web. Tim Berners-Lee has been particularly active in advocating a
"semantic web" in which resources would include the semantic information
necessary to allow machines to <em>understand</em> (not just read) them. The
W3C has set up a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">semantic web activity</a>
to promote what they view as phase two of the Internet. Some software projects,
such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, have begun trying to
take advantage of the metadata that is currently available about web resources.
The CellML development team is working to make CellML compatible with the
semantic web activity. </p>

<h2>3  CellML Metadata 1.1 Specification Structure</h2>

<p>The CellML Metadata 1.1 Specification is divided into a core specification
(current document,) and a number of subspecifications which depend on the
framework defined by the core specification.</p>

<p>These subspecifications are currently: </p>
<ul>
  <li>General annotation</li>
  <li>Graphing</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Biological annotation</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="sec_background" name="sec_background">2  CellML Metadata 1.1 in
RDF</a></h2>
CellML Metadata 1.1 uses the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource
Description Framework (RDF)</a> to encode descriptions of CellML elements. 

<h3><a id="sec_what_is_rdf" name="sec_what_is_rdf">2.1  What is RDF?</a></h3>

<p class="text">RDF, which stands for "Resource Description Framework", is the
W3C's recommendation for handling metadata on the web. The Resource Description
Framework is just that: it is a framework that allows you to store descriptions
(i.e. metadata) about resources. A resource can be literally anything. For the
purposes of CellML, resources can be the model document, the model itself, or
elements within the model (variables, components, connections, etc.)</p>

<h3><a id="sec_rdf_advantages" name="sec_rdf_advantages">2.2  The advantages of
using RDF</a></h3>

<p class="text">RDF by itself does not allow people to store metadata. It
merely provides a standard framework onto which various groups can hang their
metadata vocabularies. Some benefits of having this standard framework are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>It provides a common <em>attribute=value</em> data model for the
    metadata</strong>. All metadata expressed in RDF can be presented as a
    series of attributes (i.e. properties of the resource) and their values.
    For instance, one <em>attribute=value</em> pair for a CellML model might be
    <code>species=Mus musculus</code>. </li>
  <li><strong>It provides an extensible method for storing metadata of
    increasing complexity</strong>. Some metadata properties will have simple
    values, such as the species property shown above. Other metadata properties
    will have complex values. In the latter case, the value of the metadata
    property is itself considered a resource, and additional metadata
    properties are stored about it. This is made more clear by an example.
    Consider the case of the <code>creator</code> attribute. This could be
    given a simple value of the creator's name, such as <code class="xeln">John
    Doe</code>. However, it is more powerful to consider the value of the
    creator property to be a new resource (the person identified by the name
    "John Doe"). This allows the person's name to be stored as metadata about
    the new resource. This allows additional metadata to be stored about the
    person, such as the person's mailing address, phone number, etc. Most
    importantly, we don't have to know ahead of time what sorts of metadata
    processing software might want to store about the person. If a particular
    application wants to store the person's favourite colour, it can do so.
    Other applications might not recognise the meaning of the particular
    element that stores the favourite colour, but they will be able to
    understand that it is some sort of property about the resource (i.e.
    person) that is the creator of the model. This allows the application to
    handle the unknown metadata gracefully (most likely, many applications
    would at least be able to present the <em>attribute=value</em> pair to the
    user). </li>
  <li><strong>It makes it possible for applications that don't know anything
    about CellML to understand our metadata</strong>. Though not a reality yet,
    it is part of Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a semantic web. Eventually,
    search engine tools could become RDF capable. In that case, people would be
    able to perform much more powerful searches for information on the web. If
    someone wants to find all web resources created by John Doe, he/she could
    search explicitly for resources where <code>creator=John Doe</code>,
    instead of just searching for resources that contain the string "John Doe".
  </li>
  <li><strong>There are tools out there that use RDF</strong>. It is true that
    RDF is still a fledgling technology. However, there are tools out there
    that parse RDF and tools that actually use RDF to build databases,
    knowledge stores, and other such things. For instance, the W3C provides <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/">SiRPAC</a>, a Simple RDF Parser and
    Compiler which returns a graphical representation of the RDF code it is fed
    to aid in visualization of the <em>attribute=value</em> constructs as well
    as validate RDF segments. See the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/#projects">W3C's RDF project list</a> for a
    list of tools and projects using RDF. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="sec_general_structure" name="sec_general_structure">2.3  The
Generalized Structure of RDF</a></h3>

<p class="text">The <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/">Resource
Description Framework (RDF): Concepts and Abstract Syntax</a> specifies a
generalized structure. RDF's generalized structure allows many possible methods
of storing metadata. RDF's flexible data model gives one the ability to add new
classes of information without changing a previously specified schema; instead,
the new classes build on the base schema. This extensibility makes RDF
particularly appealing for use in CellML. </p>

<p class="text">In order to ensure consistency of notation, the CellML
development team has chosen one way of expressing metadata in RDF. This is the
recommended way of implementing RDF in CellML, but it is not the only way of
representing metadata. From here on, the <code class="xns">rdf</code> prefix
will be used to indicate that elements and attributes are in the RDF namespace.
